Description: The tidyomics ecosystem is a set of packages for â€™omic data analysis that work 
    together in harmony; they share common data representations and API design, consistent with the
    tidyverse ecosystem. The tidyomics package is designed to make it easy to install and load core 
    packages from the tidyomics ecosystem with a single command.
